For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).AbstractSepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/","Youtube":" ","Category":"Software","PS No.":"UP49","Domain":"Healthcare & Biomedical Devices"},{"Company":"GE Healthcare","Statement":"Warm patient mattress ","Description":" Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C.

The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement.The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm & bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick.  The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel  joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM's.When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available.

With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat” One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat” Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of Wi-Fi 6 access points - the Catalyst 9120 is truly multi-lingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols. In addition to delivering Wi-Fi, the 9120 AP also delivers Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread capabilities with the ability to add other radios via a USB interface. The Catalyst 9120 AP also has the unique capability of executing Docker-style containerized applications that could make use of the IoT radios and deliver use cases through a unified wireless infrastructure for customers, thereby reducing cost and complexity.

There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant.  N.B:        •Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.•The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.•The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.•If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces. Operation:A.Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).B.After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.  C.From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).D.Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. E.Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).F.Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.G.Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made. Problems:The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.Improvements Desired:To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)Information on availability of vehicle.Live metal temperature data from ladle.Vehicle call request with location.Driver acknowledgement for call request.Vehicle identification through code broadcast.The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.","Youtube":" ","Category":"Hardware","PS No.":"PN313","Domain":"Smart Vehicles"},{"Company":"Adani Port and SEZ Ltd","Statement":"To Predict the Optimum Vessel Turnaround Time SmartIndiaHackathonOptimumVesselTAT20191130144015.pdf","Description":" 1.At present, Adani operates more than 45 Berths PAN India and approximately 4000 Vessels calling at our Port.2.The vessel agents share the ETA by which Port Authorities manage the resource and estimates the TAT.3.Vessel TAT are dependent on various Factors like the productivity, resource allocated, Tide etc.4.The solution should be such that the Port Authorities are able to effectively predict the Optimum TAT which yields maximum revenue by clearly optimizing the resources used.

For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).AbstractSepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017).

Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant.  N.B:        •Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.•The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.•The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.•If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces. Operation:A.Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).B.After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.  C.From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).D.Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours.

Problems:The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature.

If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts I.Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate ±5V output corresponding to ±5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.II.An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.Thus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement.

Any procedure planned in medicalscans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping.The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration)between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of thesurgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use ofspecial markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICSmapping. Apart from estiablishing correspondances between the appearanceof fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas andaccurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducialsor utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. Thegoal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm fordetection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, theparticipants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on theskull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center ofthese fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system. Accruacy of theiralgorithm will be tested on the corresponding ground-truth values andgeneralization will be evaluated based on unseen test data.","Youtube":" ","Category":"Software","PS No.":"PC86","Domain":"Healthcare & Biomedical Devices"},{"Company":"Department of Atomic Energy","Statement":"Network routing protocol for infrastructure less gateway devices in man-made ","Description":" \"In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile AdhocNETworking(MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualizedMANET protocolshall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node is searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zonessuch as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed ato modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol.The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establish and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devise shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance.

Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation.Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizure A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost,portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn’t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures.The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body.The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions,continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.","Youtube":" ","Category":"Hardware","PS No.":"PC88","Domain":"Healthcare & Biomedical Devices"},{"Company":"Department of Atomic Energy","Statement":"Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls ","Description":" Steel is widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipments in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipments may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires de-assembling, inspection and then re-assembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like X-Rays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken.Solution methodologyLight waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology.As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound.Final outcomeA set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it.ChallengesSince wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less. It will be very difficult to detect and differentiate the sound signal obtained from the objects. Advances signal processing technique will be required to be developed to accomplish this task.","Youtube":" ","Category":"Hardware","PS No.":"PC89","Domain":"Security & Surveillance"},{"Company":"Dr. B R Ambedkar Institute of Technology","Statement":"A Mobile App with Virtual Reality Based Gallery for Heritage Museums of Andaman & Nicobar Islands https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw1g7aBpBZs","Description":" Andaman Nicobar Islands is a place of historical as well as tourist importance.

Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:a.Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). b.Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. c.Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.","Youtube":" ","Category":"Software","PS No.":"KB141","Domain":"Software - Web App development"},{"Company":"Government of Andhra Pradesh","Statement":"AI and OCR - To search Telugu & Urdu words in PDF present in Unicode as well as in image format ","Description":" Need to search any data from a PDF.
